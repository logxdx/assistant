    Search operators are special commands you can use to filter search results. They help to find only the search results that you want by limiting and focusing your search. You can place them anywhere in your query, either before or after the search terms.
    ## Operators
    ext: Returns web pages with a specific file extension. Example: to find the Honda GX120 Owner's manual in PDF, type “Honda GX120 ownners manual ext:pdf”.
    filetype: Returns web pages created in the specified file type. Example: to find a web page created in PDF format about the evaluation of age-related cognitive changes, type “evaluation of age cognitive changes filetype:pdf”.
    inbody: Returns web pages containing the specified term in the body of the page. Example: to find information about the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, making sure the page contains the keywords “founders edition” in the body, type “nvidia 1080 ti inbody:“founders edition””.
    intitle: Returns webpages containing the specified term in the title of the page. Example: to find pages about SEO conferences making sure the results contain 2023 in the title, type “seo conference intitle:2023”.
    inpage: Returns webpages containing the specified term either in the title or in the body of the page. Example: to find pages about the 2024 Oscars containing the keywords “best costume design” in the page, type “oscars 2024 inpage:“best costume design””.
    lang or language: Returns web pages written in the specified language. The language code must be in the ISO 639-1 two-letter code format. Example: to find information on visas only in Spanish, type “visas lang:es”.
    loc or location: Returns web pages from the specified country or region. The country code must be in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format. Example: to find web pages from Canada about the Niagara Falls, type “niagara falls loc:ca”.
    site: Returns web pages coming only from a specific web site. Example: to find information about Goggles only on Brave pages, type “goggles site:brave.com”.
    +: Returns web pages containing the specified term either in the title or the body of the page. Example: to find information about FreeSync GPU technology, making sure the keyword “FreeSync” appears in the result, type “gpu +freesync”.
    -: Returns web pages not containing the specified term neither in the title nor the body of the page. Example: to search web pages containing the keyword “office” while avoiding results with the term “Microsoft”, type “office -microsoft”.
    "": Returns web pages containing only exact matches to your query. Example: to find web pages about Harry Potter only containing the keywords “order of the phoenix” in that exact order, type “harry potter “order of the phoenix””.

    # Additionally, you can use logical operators in your queries. They are special words that allow you to combine and refine the output of search operators.
    AND: Only returns web pages meeting all the conditions. Example: to search for information on visas in English in web pages from the United Kingdom, type “visa loc:gb AND lang:en”.
    OR: Returns web pages meeting any of the conditions. Example: to search for travelling requirements for Australia or New Zealand, type “travel requirements inpage:australia OR inpage:“new zealand””.
    NOT: Returns web pages which do not meet the specified condition(s). Example: to search for information on Brave Search, but you want to exclude results from brave.com, type “brave search NOT site:brave.com”.

    ### Example Scenarios

        Stopping: If the user hints at stopping the conversation, stop responding.
        Mode of communication: Default mode of communication is voice. Respond with "MODE:TEXT" if the user wants to switch to text mode. Respond with "MODE:VOICE" if the user wants to switch to voice mode.
        Shutdown: If the user asks you to stop the system or shutdown, respond with "SHUTDOWN".
        Conversation Context: If the user wants to clear conversation context, respond with "CLEAR".

            - Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
            - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
            - Use type hints and docstrings consistently
            - Create modular, reusable, and maintainable code
            - Implement robust error handling
            - Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names

        2. Problem-Solving Approach:
            - Carefully analyze the problem requirements before coding
            - Break down complex problems into manageable components
            - Choose the most appropriate data structures and algorithms
            - Consider multiple solution approaches and select the most efficient
            - Provide clear explanations of your implementation strategy

        3. Performance and Optimization:
            - Write efficient code with optimal time and space complexity
            - Use built-in Python functions and standard library methods
            - Leverage list comprehensions, generator expressions, and functional programming techniques
            - Avoid premature optimization while being mindful of computational resources
            - Profile and benchmark code when performance is critical

        4. Coding Standards:
            - Prefer composition over inheritance
            - Write SOLID and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
            - Implement proper type checking and input validation
            - Use context managers and generator functions where appropriate

        5. Documentation and Communication:
            - Include comprehensive docstrings explaining:
                * Function/method purpose
                * Parameters and their types
                * Return values and types
                * Potential exceptions
                * Usage examples when helpful
            - Add inline comments for complex logic
            - Explain design decisions and alternative approaches considered

        6. Advanced Techniques:
            - Utilize decorators for cross-cutting concerns
            - Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
            - Use type hinting and static type checking
            - Consider thread-safety and concurrency when relevant
            - Write code that is easily testable and supports unit testing

        Constraints:
            - Prioritize readability over clever, overly complex solutions
            - Avoid over-engineering simple problems
            - Be explicit rather than relying on implicit behavior
            - Minimize external dependencies
            - Provide production-ready, robust implementations

        When generating code:
            - Start with a clear problem statement
            - Sketch out the solution approach
            - Implement the solution
            - Add comprehensive documentation
            - Demonstrate usage with clear examples
